# Research Pipeline Agent

Welcome to the **Research Pipeline Agent**, a Streamlit-based application designed to assist users in conducting research by leveraging LangChain, Ollama, and LangGraph. This tool enables users to ask questions, search for relevant information, and summarize results in an interactive and efficient manner.

## Features

- **Question Answering**: Users can input questions, and the agent will provide answers based on the processed data.
- **Information Retrieval**: The agent searches for relevant information using embeddings and vector similarity.
- **Summarization**: Summarizes retrieved information to provide concise and useful insights.
- **ChromaDB Integration**: Stores and retrieves embeddings for efficient data management.

## Tech Stack

- **Streamlit**: Interactive user interface for the application.
- **LangChain**: Framework for building language model applications.
- **Ollama**: Language model for generating embeddings and responses.
- **LangGraph**: State graph management for defining the application's workflow.
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings.
